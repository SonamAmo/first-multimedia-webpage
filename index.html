      written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur
      under his Hombale Films banner. It serves as the direct sequel to KGF:
      Chapter 1 (2018), as well as the second installment in the KGF franchise.
      The film stars an ensemble cast of Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon,

      with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the

      marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot
      simultaneously with Chapter 1. Principal photography for the rest of the
      sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in March 2020 owing to
      the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later in
      August 2020 and was completed in December 2020. Locations included
      Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar.
